The Conceptual Plan:

Week 1: Environment & RAM Integration
Build Gymnasium env with emulator
Read key RAM values (player coords, map ID, story flags, dialogue state)
Return combined obs: pixels + RAM-based state
Define action space (movement, interact, menu)
Test env stability and correctness

Week 2: Expand RAM Coverage & Encoding
Add more story/event flags (badges, key items, NPC flags)
One-hot encode categorical states (maps, dialogues)
Normalize numeric RAM values
Debug tools for readable story state
Scripted navigation tests (move to map coords)

Week 3: Navigation & Basic Interaction Training
Train PPO on overworld navigation tasks (reach coords, enter buildings)
Train item pickup and basic item use (open bag, use item)
Reward shaping for goal reaching & item use success

Week 4: Battle State & Basic Combat Skills
Add battle RAM reads (HP, battle state, moves)
Train PPO to win simple wild battles (move choice, switching, item use)
Combine navigation + battle training

Week 5: Healing & Quest Progression
Train healing (navigate to Pok√©mon Center, trigger heal)
Train quest actions (talk NPC, deliver items, trigger events)
Chain subtasks in curriculum episodes

Week 6: Full Story Integration & Long-Term Goals
Combine all skills into unified policy or hierarchical controller
Train on longer episodes (beat gyms, complete quests, explore)
Log story progress & decisions
Evaluate full game autonomous play
